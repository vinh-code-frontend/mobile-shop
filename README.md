# Mobile shop (2025)

My graduation project was to build a mobile phone shop, it was enough for me to graduate but after a few years of working, I found it was not good enough and decided to rebuild it.

This is also an opportunity for me to learn more new technologies.
##

**Old techs**: PHP, Laravel, MySQL

**Intended new techs**: React, Typescript, ASP.NET, MSSQL
